  <p>I, Arpita Shanbhag, am a hopeful, young individual who wants to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science to make a difference in the industry and I consistently strive to work towards this long-term goal through my steps and actions in high school that will lead up to college and eventually take me into the engineering workforce.</p>
  <p>Ever since I was in 8th grade, I've been fascinated by the possibilities that computer science presented. My interest in computer science was sparked by my interest in artificial intelligence, due to the sudden increase in concern and popularity in this area. As a freshman in high school, I'm currently exploring this passion through my coursework in mathematics and computer science essentials. These subjects have provided me with the knowledge needed to understand the principles of coding. Although my experience with coding is limited, I've started to learn more about coding in different languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I hope to make a difference in the community with my developing skills in these languages in the future.</p>

  <p>This year, I had the opportunity to participate in the DEDA Entrepreneurship Project, where we worked on pitching a product to solve a real-world problem. Despite my limited coding experience, I took on the challenge of programming the back end of the program with JavaScript. Through this project, I learned the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, perseverance, and having a growth-mindset. When I was working on this project, the proud feeling I had after completing the project, gave me the motivation to continue pursuing this path and hopefully solve more problems in the future with the power of computers.</p>

  <p>Looking ahead, I plan to deepen my understanding of computer science. I want to take more advanced courses such as AP CSP and AP CSA and participate in internships or hackathons that provide hands-on experience. My goal is to become proficient in coding and develop a strong technical skill set to help me succeed in my future career path and have a solid foundation. Ultimately, I hope to make more innovative projects that positively impact society using my knowledge of computer science starting from small technical steps today.</p>
